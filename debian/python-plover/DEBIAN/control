Description: ('Open Source Stenography Software',)
 Plover is a stenotype input method for X11. It allows input of English text using
 chords rather than letter by letter, enabling typing speeds to approach 300wpm
 for a skilled user. It can use a dedicated stenotype machine, or a standard
 QWERTY keyboard as long as it permits chords to be passed to the computer.
 .
 Plover is written in Python. The licence is GPL v2. Its name rhymes with
 "lover", not "over", just as with the name of the wading bird.
